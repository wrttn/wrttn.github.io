*Statement to an Emergency Session of the UN Security Council on the Situation in Ukraine*
*Delivered: 22 February. 2022*

...

Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.

We meet tonight on the brink of a major conflict in Ukraine. The diplomacy we urged on the 
17th of February is failing. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine stands 
breached. The Charter of the United Nations continues to wilt under the relentless assault 
of the powerful. In one moment, it is invoked with reverence by the very same countries who 
then turn their backs on it in pursuit of objectives diametrically opposed to international 
peace and security.

In the last two meetings on the situation in Ukraine, and the build up of forces by the 
Russian Federation, Kenya urged that diplomacy be given a chance. Our cry was not heeded 
and, more importantly, the Charter’s demand for states to settle their international 
disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and 
justice are not endangered has been profoundly undermined.

Today, the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political 
independence of Ukraine has been effected. Kenya is gravely concerned by the announcement 
made by the Russian Federation to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as 
independent states. In our considered view, this action and announcement breaches the 
territorial integrity of -- of Ukraine.

We do not deny that there may be serious security concerns in these regions. But they 
cannot justify today’s recognition of these regions as independent states -- not when 
there are multiple diplomatic tracks available and underway that have the ability to 
offer peaceful solutions.

Mr. President,

This situation echoes our history. Kenya and almost every African country was birthed 
by the ending of empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in 
the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris, and Lisbon, with no regard for the 
ancient nations that they cleaved apart.

Today, across the border of every single African country, live our countrymen with 
whom we share deep historical, cultural, and linguistic bonds. At independence, had 
we chosen to pursue states on the basis of ethnic, racial, or religious homogeneity, 
we would still be waging bloody wars these many decades later.

Instead, we agreed that we would settle for the borders that we inherited, but we 
would still pursue continental political, economic, and legal integration. Rather 
than form nations that looked ever backwards into history with a dangerous nostalgia,
we chose to look forward to a greatness none of our many nations and peoples had 
ever known. We chose to follow the rules of the Organisation of African Unity and 
the United Nations charter, not because our borders satisfied us, but because we 
wanted something greater, forged in peace.

We believe that all states formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated 
have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighboring 
states. This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be 
joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them? However, Kenya 
rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force. We must complete our recovery 
from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new 
forms of domination and oppression.

We rejected irredentism and expansionism on any basis, including racial, ethnic, 
religious, or cultural factors. We -- We reject it again today. Kenya registers 
its strong concern and opposition to the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as 
independent states. We further strongly condemn the trend in the last few decades 
of powerful states, including members of this Security Council, breaching 
international law with little regard.

Multilateralism lies on its deathbed tonight. It has been assaulted today as 
it as it has been by other powerful states in the recent past. We call on all 
members to rally behind the Secretary-General in asking him to rally us all to 
the standard that defends multilateralism. We also call on him to bring his good 
offices to bear to help the concerned parties resolve this situation by peaceful 
means.

Let me conclude, Mr. President, by reaffirming Kenya's respect for the territorial 
integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.

Thank you.
