*Learning in War-Time*
*by C. S. Lewis A sermon preached in the Church of St. Mary the Virgin,*
*Oxford,Autumn, 1939*

A University is a society for the pursuit of learning. As
students, you will be expected to make yourselves, or to
start making yourselves, in to what the Middle Ages called
clerks: into philosophers, scientists, scholars, critics, or
historians. And at first sight this seems to be an odd thing to
do during a great war. What is the use of beginning a task
which we have so little chance of finishing? Or, even if we
ourselves should happen not to be interrupted by death or
military service, why should we -- indeed how can we --
continue to take an interest in these placid occupations
when the lives of our friends and the liberties of Europe are
in the balance? Is it not like fiddling while Rome burns?

Now it seems to me that we shall not be able to answer
these questions until we have put them by the side of
certain other questions which every Christian ought to have
asked himself in peace-time. I spoke just now of fiddling
while Rome burns. But to a Christian the true tragedy of
Nero must be not that he fiddles while the city was on fire
but that he fiddles on the brink of hell. You must forgive me
for the crude monosyllable. I know that many wiser and
better Christians than I in these days do not like to mention
heaven and hell even in a pulpit. I know, too, that nearly all
the references to this subject in the New Testament come
from a single source. But then that source is Our Lord
Himself. People will tell you it is St. Paul, but that is untrue.
These overwhelming doctrines are dominical. They are not
really removable from the teaching of Christ or of His
Church. If we do not believe them, our presence in this
church is great tomfoolery. If we do, we must sometime
overcome our spiritual prudery and mention them. The
moment we do so we can see that every Christian who
comes to a university must at all times face a question
compared with which the questions raised by the war are
relatively unimportant. He must ask himself how it is right,
or even psychologically possible,for creatures who are every
moment advancing either to heaven or to hell, to spend any
fraction of the little time allowed them in this world on such
comparative trivialities as literature or art, mathematics or
biology. If human culture can stand up to that, it can stand
up to anything. To admit that we can retain our interest in
learning under the shadow of these eternal issues, but not
under the shadow of a European war, would be to admit
that our ears are closed to the voice of reason and very wide
open to the voice of our nerves and our mass emotions.

This indeed is the case with most of us: certainly with me.
For that reason I think it important to try to see the present
calamity in a true perspective, The war creates no absolutely
new situation: it simply aggravates the permanent human
situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has
always been lived on the edge of a precipice. Human culture
has always had to exist under the shadow of something
infinitely more important than itself. If men had postponed
the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure
the search would never have begun. We are mistaken when
we compare war with "normal life". Life has never been
normal. Even those periods which we think most tranquil,
like the nineteenth century, turn out, on closer inspection, to
be full of cries, alarms, difficulties, emergencies. Plausible
reasons have never been lacking for putting off all merely
cultural activities until some imminent danger has been
averted or some crying injustice put right. But humanity long
ago chose to neglect those plausible reasons. They wanted
knowledge and beauty now, and would not wait for the
suitable moment that never come. Periclean Athens leaves
us not only the Parthenon but, significantly, the Funeral
Oration. The insects have chosen a different line: they have
sought first the material welfare and security of the hive,
and presumable they have their reward. Men are
different.They propound mathematical theorems in
beleaguered cities, conduct metaphysical arguments in
condemned cells, make jokes on scaffold, discuss, the last
new poem while advancing to the walls of Quebec, and
comb their hair at Thermopylae. This is not panache; it is
our nature.

But since we are fallen creatures the fact that this is now our
nature would not, by itself, prove that it is rational or right.
We have to inquire whether there is really any legitimate
place for the activities of the scholar in a world such as this.
That is, we have always to answer the question: "How can
you be so frivolous and selfish as to think about anything
but the salvation of human souls?" and we have, at the
moment, to answer the additional question,
"How can you be so frivolous and selfish as to think of anything but the
war?" Now part of our answer will be the same for both
questions. The one implies that our life can, and ought, to
become exclusively and explicitly religious: the other, that it
can and ought to become exclusively national. I believe that
our whole life can, and indeed must, become religious in a
sense to be explained later. But if it is meant that all our
activities are to be of the kind that can be recognized as
"sacred" and ties are to be of the kind that can be
recognized as "sacred" and opposed to "secular" then I
would give a single reply to both my imaginary assailants. I
would say,
"Whether it ought to happen or not, the thing
you are recommending is not going to happen." Before I
became a Christian I do not think I fully realized that one's
life, after conversion, would inevitably consist in doing most
of the same things one had been doing before: one hopes,
in a new spirit, but still the same things. Before I went to the
last war I certainly expected that my life in the trenches
would, in some mysterious sense, be all war. In fact, I found
that the nearer you got to the front line the less everyone
spoke and thought of the allied cause and the progress of
the campaign; and I am pleased to find that Tolstoy, in the
greatest war book ever written, records the same thing --
and so, in its own way, does the Iliad. Neither conversion
nor enlistment in the army is really going to obliterate our
human life. Christians and solders are still men: the infidel's
idea of a religious life, and the civilian's idea of active
service, are fantastic. If you attempted, in either case, to
suspend your whole intellectual and aesthetic activity, you
would only succeed in substituting a worse cultural life for a
better. You are not, in fact, going to read nothing, either in
the Church or in the line: if you don't read good books you
will read bad ones. If you don't go on thinking rationally, you
will think irrationally. If you reject aesthetic satisfactions you
will fall into sensual satisfactions. There is therefore this
analogy between the claims of our religion and the claims of
the war: neither of them for most of us, will simply cancel or
remove from the slate the merely human life which we were
leading before we entered them. But they will operate in this
way for different reasons. The war will fail to absorb our
whole attention because it is a finite object, and therefore
intrinsically unfitted to support the whole attention of a
human soul. In order to avoid misunderstanding I must here
make a few distinctions. I believe our cause to be, as human
causes go, very righteous, and I therefore believe it to be a
duty to participate in this war. And every duty is a religious
duty, and our obligation to perform every duty is therefore
absolute. Thus we may have a duty to rescue a drowning
man, and perhaps, if we live on a dangerous coast, to learn
life-saving so as to be ready for any drowning man when he
turns up. It may be our duty to lose our own lives in saving
him. But if anyone devoted himself to life-saving in the
sense of giving it his total attention --so that he thought and
spoke of nothing else and demanded the cessation of all
other human activities until everyone had learned to swim --
he would be a monomaniac. The rescue of drowning men is,
then aduty worth dying for, but not worth living for. It
seems to me that all political duties (among which I include
military duties) are of this kind. A man may have to die for
our country: but no man must, in any exclusive sense, live
for his country. He who surrenders himself without
reservation to the temporal claims of a nation, or a party, or
a class is rendering to Caesar that which, of all things, most
emphatically belongs to God: himself. It is for a very
different reason that religion cannot occupy the whole of life
in the sense of excluding all our natural activities. For, of
course, in some sense, it must occupy the whole of life.
There is no question of a compromise between the claims of
God and the claims of culture, or politics, or anything else.
God's claim is infinite and inexorable. You can refuse it: or
you can begin to try to grant it. There is no middle way. Yet
in spite of this it is clear that Christianity does not exclude
any of the ordinary human activities. St. Paul tells people to
get on with their jobs. He even assumes that Christians may
go to dinner parties, and, what is more, dinner parties given
by pagans. Our Lord attends a wedding and provides
miraculous wine. Under the aegis of His Church, and in the
most Christian ages, learning and the arts flourish. The
solution of this paradox is, of course, well know to you.
"Whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
glory of God." All our merely natural activities will be
accepted, if they are offered to God, even the humblest: and
all of them, even the noblest, will be sinful if they are not.
Christianity does not simply replace our natural life and
substitute a new one: it is rather a new organization which
exploits, to its own supernatural ends, these natural
materials. No doubt, in a given situation, it demands the
surrender of some, or al all, our merely human pursuits: it is
better to be saved with one eye, than, having two, to be
cast into Gehanna. But it does this, in a sense, per accidens
-- because, in those special circumstances, it has ceased to
be possible to practice this or that activity to the glory of
God. There is no essential quarrel between the spiritual life
and the human activities as such. Thus the omnipresence of
obedience to God in a Christian's life is, in a way, analogous
to the omnipresence of God in space. God does not fill space
as a body fills it, in the sense that parts of Him are in
different parts of space, excluding other object from them.
Yet He is everywhere -- totally present at every point of
space --according to good theologians.

We are now in a position to answer the view that human
culture is an inexcusable frivolity on the part of creatures
loaded with such awful responsibilities as we. I reject at
once an idea which lingers in the mind of some modern
people that cultural activities are in their own right
spiritual and meritorious -- as though scholars and poets
were intrinsically more pleasing to God than scavengers and
bootblacks. I think it was Matthew Arnold who first used the
English word spiritual in the sense of the German geistlich,
and so inaugurated this most dangerous and most antiChristian error. Let us clear it forever from our minds.The
work of a Beethoven, and the work of a charwoman,
become spiritual on precisely the same condition, that of
being offered to God, of being done humbly "as to the Lord".
This does not, of course, mean that it is for anyone a mere
toss-up whether he should sweep rooms or compose
symphonies. A mole must dig to the glory of God and a cock
must crow. We are members of one body, but differentiated
members, each with his own vocation. A man's upbringing,
his talents, his circumstances, are usually a tolerable index
of his vocation. If our parents have sent us to Oxford, if our
country allows us to remain there, this is prima facie
evidence that the life which we, at any rate, can best lead to
the glory of God at present is the learned life.

By leading that life to the glory of God I do not, of course,
mean any at tempt to make our intellectual inquiries work
out to edifying conclusions. That would be, as Bacon says, to
offer to the author of truth the unclean sacrifice of a lie. I
mean the pursuit of knowledge and beauty, in a sense, for
their own sake, but in a sense which does not exclude their
being for God's sake. An appetite for these things exists in
the human mind, and God makes no appetite in vain. We
can therefore pursue knowledge as such, and beauty, as
such, in the sure confidence that by so doing we are either
advancing to the vision of God ourselves or indirectly helping
others to do so. Humility, no less than the appetite,
encourages us to concentrate simply on the knowledge or
the beauty, not too much concerning ourselves with their
ultimate relevance to the vision of God. That relevance may
not be intended for us but for our betters -- for men who
come after and find the spiritual significance of what we dug
out in blind and humble obedience to our vocation. This is
the teleological argument that the existence of the impulse
and the faculty prove that they must have a proper function
in God's scheme -- the argument by which Thomas Aquinas
probes that sexuality would have existed even without the
Fall. The soundness of the argument, as regards culture, is
proved by experience. The intellectual life is not the only
road to God, nor the safest, but we find it to be a road, and
it may be the appointed road for us. Of course, it will be so
only so long as we keep the impulse pure and disinterested.
That is the great difficulty. As the author of the Theologia
Germanicai says, we may come to love knowledge -- our
knowing -- more than the thing known: to delight not in the
exercise of our talents but in the fact that they are ours, or
even in the reputation they bring us. Every success in the
scholar's life increases this danger. If it becomes irresistible,
he must give up his scholarly work. The time for plucking
our the right eye has arrived.

That is the essential nature of the learned life as I see it. But
it has indirect values which are especially important today. If
all the world were Christian, it might not matter if all the
world were uneducated. But, as it is, a cultural life will exist
outside the Church whether it exists inside or not. To be
ignorant and simple now -- not to be able to meet the
enemies on their own ground -- would be to throw down our
weapons, and the betray our uneducated brethren who
have, under God, no defense but us against the intellectual
attacks of the heathen. Good philosophy must exist, if for no
other reason, because bad philosophy needs to be
answered. The cool intellect must work not only against cool
intellect on the other side, but against the muddy heathen
mysticisms which deny intellect altogether.

Most of all, perhaps we need intimate knowledge of the
past. Not that the past has any magic about it, but because
we cannot study the future, and yet need something to set
against the present, to remind us that periods and that
much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely
temporary fashion. A man who has lived in many place is not
likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village:
the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some
degree immune form the great cataract of nonsense that
pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.

The learned life then is, for some, a duty. At the moment it
looks as if it were your duty. I am well aware that there may
seem to be an almost comic discrepancy between the high
issues we have been considering and the immediate task
you may be set down to, such as Anglo-Saxon sound laws or
chemical formulae. But there is a similar shock awaiting us in
every vocation -- a young priest finds himself involved in
choir treats and a young subaltern in accounting for pots of
jam. It is well that it should be so. It weeds out the vain,
windy people and keeps in those who are both humble and
tough. On that kind of difficulty we need waste no
sympathy.

But the peculiar difficulty imposed on you by the war is
another matter: and of it I would again repeat, what I have
been saying in one form or another ever since I started -- do
not let your nerves and emotions lead you into thinking your
present predicament more abnormal than it really is.
Perhaps it may be useful to mention the three mental
exercises which may serve as defenses against the three
enemies which war raises up against the scholar. The first
enemy is excitement -- the tendency to think and feel about
the war when we had intended to think about our work. The
best defense is a recognition that in this, as in everything
else, the war has not really raised up a new enemy but only
aggravated an old one. There are always plenty of rivals to
our work. We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking
for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering,
following public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always
be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we
can really get down to our work. The only people who
achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that
they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable.
Favorable conditions never come. There are, of course,
moments when the pressure of the excitement is so great
that any superhuman self-control could not resist it. They
come both in war and peace. We must do the best we can.

The second enemy is frustration -- the feeling that we shall
not have time to finish. If I say to you that no one has time
to finish, that the longest human life leaves a man, in any
branch of learning, a beginner, I shall seem to you to be
saying something quite academic and theoretical. You would
be surprised if you knew how soon one begins to feel the
shortness of the tether: of how many things, even in middle
life, we lave to say "No time for that",
"Too late now", and
"Not for me". But Nature herself forbids you to share that
experience. A more Christian attitude, which can be attained
at any age, is that of leaving futurity in God's hands. We
may as well, for God will certainly retain it whether we leave
it to Him or not. Never, in peace or war, commit your virtue
or your happiness to the future. Happy work is best done by
the man who takes his long-term plans somewhat lightly and
works from moment to moment "as to the Lord". It is only
our daily bread that we are encouraged to ask for. The
present is the only time in which any duty can be done or
any grace received.

The third enemy is fear. War threatens us with death and
pain. No man -- and specially no Christian who remembers
Gethsemane -- need try to attain a stoic indifference about
these things: but we can guard against the illusions of the
imagination. We think of the streets of Warsaw and contrast
the deaths there suffered with an abstraction called Life. But
there is no question of death or life for any of us; only a
question of this death or of that -- of a machine gun bullet
now or a cancer forty years later. What does war do to
death? It certainly does not make it more frequent; 100 per
cent of us die, and the percentage cannot be increased. It
puts several deaths earlier; but I hardly suppose that that is
what we fear. Certainly when the moment comes, it will
make little difference how many years we have behind us.
Does it increase our chance of a painful death? I doubt it. As
far as I can find out, what we call natural death is usually
preceded by suffering; and a battlefield is one of the very
few places where one has a reasonable prospect of dying
with no pain at all. Does it decrease our chances of dying at
peace with God? I cannot believe it. If active service does
not persuade a man to prepare for death, what conceivable
concatenation of circumstance would? Yet war does do
something to death. It forces us to remember it. The only
reason why the cancer at sixty or the paralysis at seventyfive do not bother us is that we forget them. War makes
death real to us: and that would have been regarded as one
of its blessings by most of the great Christians of the past.
They thought it good for us to be always aware of our
mortality. I am inclined to think they were right.

All the animal life in us, all schemes of happiness that
centered in this world, were always doomed to a final
frustration. In ordinary times only a wise man can realize it.
Now the stupidest of us know. We see unmistakable the sort
of universe in which we have all along been living, and must
come to terms with it. If we had foolish un-Christian hopes
about human culture, they are now shattered. If we thought
we were building up a heaven on earth, if we looked for
something that would turn the present world from a place of
pilgrimage into a permanent city satisfying the soul of man,
we are disillusioned, and not a moment too soon. But if we
thought that for some souls, and at some times, the life of
learning, humbly offered to God, was, in its own small way,
one of the appointed approaches to the Divine reality and
the Divine beauty which we hope to enjoy hereafter, we can
think so still.
