If Nature Study be your goal,
Take note: a single part reflects the whole.
Nought is within and nought without,
For what is in is also out.
So grasp without delay this prize:
That here a holy public secret lies.
Rejoice in true illusions's fame,
Rejoice in Nature's serious game.
No living thing alone can be - 
It only exists in company.
