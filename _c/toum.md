## Ingredients

- 3 C neutral flavoured oil (grapeseed, avacado or canola)
- 1 C unchopped, peeled garlic cloves
- 1/2 C lemon juice (roughly 2 lemons)
- 2 tsp salt

## Method

- Make sure peeled garlic and lemons are in the fridge before starting. The colder temperature of these ingredients helps with the emulsification process.
- Add salt and garlic to a food processor or blender. Mince. You may need to scrape garlic bits from the sides and pulse multiple times to get the garlic well blended at this stage. The salt is abrasive on the garlic and helps break it down. 
- With food processor running, slowly pour in a few drops of oil. Scrape down bowl. Blend again. Continue with a few more tablespoons of oil.
- Next, blend while slowly alternatively adding oil, then a bit of lemon juice until both are done. The toum will get fluffy and white about 1/3 to half way through the addition of the oil.
- Transfer to glass container. Optional: keep in fridge covered with a cloth towel overnight to let garlic flavour become less sharp. Finally, put air tight lid on. 
- Keep in fridge for up to 3 months. 
- It is possible your toum "breaks". This is when the emulsification doesn't work properly and oil/water remain separate after you stop blending. Make sure you're using cold garlic and lemon at the start. Also make sure your garlic get's pulverized enough before you add too much oil. There are components in the garlic that need to be released to help the emulsification process.
- If your toum does break (it can happen!), you can save it by slowly adding the broken toum to a blender that has a "successful" toum in it. Either use an existing toum, or start a second batch (potentially with 1/2 of the ingredients above) to get a successful to work with.
